Capstone Project ICCT Colleges LMS with Code Generator for Classroom 

This is my Capstone Project from 2022. It was developed for over 6 months aiming with the goal to create our own college a learning management system.

ICCT LMS is a responsive website that can be used in any devices.<br>
<br>
This project can be used with the teacher and student with separate UI access on their respective role. <br>
For teachers, they can create a classroom with code for students to get access to, create quiz or exam, upload a file and grade every activity.<br>
For students, they also have the feature to enter the code given by their teachers and enter the class as well as upload their activities.
